"PLoM_algorithm.py" runs th algorithm for a 20-D problem, there's  a commented line if the initial data has to be read form a '.dat' file.

"PLoM_C_library.c" contains three functions of the algorithm in C.

"PLoM_C_library.o" and "PLoM_C_library.so"  are shared libraries of the "PLoM_C_library.c" file.

"PLoM_library_ubuntu.py" contains all the needed functions in the algorithm. It is the library to be run in an ubuntu bash. 

"PLoM_no_constraints - competition.py" runs the algorithm without constraints for a 20-D problem.
