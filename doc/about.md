## About

**PLoM** is an open source python package that implements the algorithm of **Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds** with and without 
constraints ([Soize and Ghanem, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2016.05.044); [Soize and Ghanem, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.6202)) 
for ***generating realizations of a random vector in a finite Euclidean space that are statistically consistent with a given dataset of that vector***. 
The package mainly consists of python modules and invokes a dynamic library for more efficiently computing the gradient of potential, 
and can be imported and run on Linux, macOS, and Windows platform. This repository also archives the unit/integration tests and 
examples of applying the algorithm to practical engineering problems.
